Welcome! Iâ€™m Hannah, a cognitive neuroscientist studying human memory. My research investigates how we form memories for our past experiences and how we use those memories to guide adaptive, future-oriented behaviour. To do so, I leverage a variety of behavioural, neuroimaging, and computational methods.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto, where I work with [Morris Moscovitch](https://neuropsychologylab.psych.utoronto.ca/index.html) and [Asaf Gilboa](https://www.gilboalab.ca/). I received my PhD in 2023 from Columbia University in New York City under the supervision of [Mariam Aly](https://www.alylab.org/) and [Chris Baldassano](https://www.dpmlab.org/). Prior to my PhD, I received a Bachelor of Science in Psychology (Research Specialization) and a Bachelor of Music in Performance (Classical Voice) from the University of Toronto.
